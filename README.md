# Base64-Tool-Android
Tool to Encode/Decode Base64 by 0xAREEB (aka Cheat4Fun)

# How It Works ?
* All buttons, textViews, editTexts are in res/layout/activity_main.xml
* Components are styled in MainActivity.java
* The text entered is encoded/decoded and copied to Clipboard.

# Issues :joy:
* Keyboard lags on focus into the editText
* Encoded text contains line breaks
* idk if there are other issues/bugs
